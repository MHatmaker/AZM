    <h2>Legend types and the nature of your data</h2>

    <p><strong>Sequential schemes:&nbsp;</strong> are suited to ordered data that progress from low to high.  Lightness steps dominate the look of these schemes, with light colors for low data values to dark colors for high data values.</p>

    <p><strong>Diverging schemes:&nbsp;</strong> put equal emphasis on mid-range critical values and extremes at both ends of the data range.  The critical class or break in the middle of the legend is emphasized with light colors and low and high extremes are emphasized with dark colors that have contrasting hues.</p>
